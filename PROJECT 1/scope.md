# Project Scope Statement

## Project Purpose
The purpose of this project is to apply the project management principle of scoping to a tangible technical task. I want to define clear objectives, deliverables, and limitations before development begins. I hope this project demonstrates how effective my planning is in improving focus, efficiency, and outcomes in technical work. I have yet to learn more and understand the concept. I want to deliver exceptional work and be task-oriented so that I can learn and apply the skills I gain in this class. 

## Project Description
This project consists of creating two deliverables: a formal project scope statement written in Markdown and a simple, single-page personal website built using semantic HTML. The scope statement defines the project's purpose, expectations, and boundaries, while the HTML webpage provides a practical implementation of that scope by presenting personal and professional information.

## Desired Results
- A completed scope statement that follows the PMUPM Chapter 3 template  
- A valid HTML document that meets all assignment requirements  
- Clear alignment between the project plan and the technical outcome  
- Improved understanding of scope definition and scope control  
- Demonstrated ability to translate planning documentation into a working technical artifact  

## Exclusions
- CSS styling or visual design enhancements  
- JavaScript or interactive functionality  
- Backend development or database integration  
- Website deployment or hosting  
- Additional pages beyond the single required HTML file
