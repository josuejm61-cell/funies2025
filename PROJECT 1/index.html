    <h2>Computer Applications</h2>

    <p>
        One of my primary goals for this course is to understand how project management
        principles apply to real-world technical tasks. Learning how to properly define
        scope and plan deliverables will help me approach projects in a more organized
        and efficient way.
    </p>

    <p>
        From a career perspective, I am interested in building a strong technical
        foundation while also developing planning and documentation skills. These
        abilities will support my growth in computer applications and related
        professional roles.
